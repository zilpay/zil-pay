ZilPay represents the inaugural quantum-resistant, multi-currency decentralized wallet, functioning as a browser extension compatible with the EVM-compatible networks. It empowers developers to integrate ZilPay into their websites for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), leveraging post-quantum cryptography for enhanced security across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism.
